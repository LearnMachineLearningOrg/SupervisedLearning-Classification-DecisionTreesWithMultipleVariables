# SupervisedLearning-Classification-DecisionTreesWithMultipleVariables
This repository consists of implementation of Decision trees machine learning algorithm with multiple variables.

Machine Learning concept being worked on:

Decision Tree Analysis is a general, predictive modelling tool that has applications spanning a number of different areas. In general, decision trees are constructed via an algorithmic approach that identifies ways to split a data set based on different conditions. It is one of the most widely used and practical methods for supervised learning. 

1. Decision trees machine learning algorithm falls under supervised learning.
2. Decision trees falls under the classification category.
3. In Decision trees, the data set that we process will have a set of features in each example along with a label. The value of label will be discrete instead of real / continous value.
3. In Decision tree algorithm, we will learn a model. Based on the examples in the given dataset we will be able to predict the value of label (which will be discrete)

In this example we will Decision tree algorithm to classify whether a customer will purchase or will not purchase. For this we learn a model based on the data provided about the customers, given their age and estimated salary.

1. Dataset being used: social_network_ads.csv
2. Feature being used: Age, EstimatedSalary
3. Label being predicted: Purchase
 
Python modules being used:

1. os: This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
2. pandas: Pandas provide high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures.
3. numpy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
4. matplotlib: matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language.
5. sklearn: It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN
